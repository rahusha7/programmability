# Introduction

Ever dreamed of a test framework that could be used across multiple platforms, OS and vendors, which could do regression, sanity and feature testing; already used by thousands of engineers and developers worldwide? Guess what, **it exists, itâ€™s free, and you can start using it right now!**

pyATS (**Py**thon **A**utomated **T**est **S**ystems, to be pronounced "py A. T. S.") was first created as an internal project, to ease the validation of two OS versions. It has been made public in 2017 through **Cisco Devnet**.

Many thanks to **Romain Cyrille**, Cisco CX Engineer, for his help writting this article!

# Abstract

In this new episode, we will see how to add configuration to a device, confirm the changes (looking at operational data) and then clean the configuration. We will then compare three ways to remove configuration to go back to default. We will do all this changes using pyATS.

We will manipulate Segment Routing Traffic Engineering in today's use case. We will send traffic from a source to a destination and influence the traffic's path using Segment Routing Policies.

Manipulating configuration can be done with pyATS but it might not be the ideal tool for you. Here, we use pyATS because we are in a lab and we can't break anything (most important, we don't care if we do). Based on your use case, you might consider other tools like Crosswork, NSO or Ansible.

# Network Topology

In today's article, we will use the Segment Routing network topology, based on IOS XRd. It's available [on this github repo](https://github.com/ios-xr/xrd-tools/blob/main/samples/xr_compose_topos/segment-routing/docker-compose.xr.yml).

The topology in the above repo has been slightly changed to adapt to our use case. For instance, we are using proper IOS XRd routers as source and destination (not linux hosts), so we can benefit from all IOS XR networking features.
You can find those changes (each node `startup configuration` and `docker-compose.xr.yaml`) [here](https://github.com/AntoineOrsoni/xrdocs-how-to-pyats/tree/master/5_config_builder/ios%20xrd).

You can read more on XRDocs about what's IOS XRd and how to use it [here](https://xrdocs.io/virtual-routing/tutorials/).

The topology will look like below. We will send traffic between a source and a destination (linux hosts) and influence the traffic's path using Segment Routing Policies.

## IP Addressing

**Management IP** addresses are in the range `172.40.0.0/24`.
`101` to `108` are respectively associated from `xrd-1` to `xrd-8`
`200` and `201` are respectively associated to `xrd-source` and `xrd-dest`.

**Adjacency links** addresses are in the range `100.0.0.0/8`.
Second and third byte are associated with the two routers on each side of the link. Fourth byte represents the node.
Ex: `100.106.108.0/24` represents the link between `xrd-6` and `xrd-8`.
`100.106.108.108` belong to an interface on `xrd-8`.

**Source and Destination** addresses are respectively `10.1.1.2` and `10.3.1.3`.

# Pushing Configuration to a device

In this first step, we are going to see that pushing configuration with pyATS is easy. I would not suggest using this solution when pushing a complex end-to-end service where you would need advanced features such as rollback capabilities. In a lab environment, it's good enough and it has the advantage to be very simple.

Manipulating configuration can be done with pyATS but it might not be the ideal tool for you. Here, we use pyATS because we are in a lab and we can't break anything (most important, we don't care if we do). Based on your use case, you might consider other tools like Crosswork, NSO or Ansible.

Once connected to a device using pyATS, you can use the `configure()` method to push configuration. It takes a `string` as parameter, which is the configuration to be pushed. Below an example for a segment-routing policy. You can pass multiple lines of configuration to the `configure()` method.

You can read more about how to configure devices with pyATS in the [documentation](https://pubhub.devnetcloud.com/media/pyats-getting-started/docs/quickstart/configuredevices.html)

# Removing configuration from a device

Removing configuration can be slightly more complex than pushing configuration. In this part, we are going to explore 3 differerents ways to achieve that goal:
- Downloading a `base configuration template` on the device, and loading it.
- Doing a configuration rollback to a previous commit.
- Using `configure()` method to unconfigure what we have done (i.e. adding `no` at the beginning of each configuration section).

In all three scenarios, we will remove the segment routing policy configuration. We will compare the pros and cons for each option.
